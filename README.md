### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Codingbysid/HeardAI1.git
   cd HeardAI1
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open HeardAI.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure API Key**
   - The Google Speech API key is already configured in `Info.plist`
   - Current key: `0ac4a773d6788813e45539a3ee8c4bdf6767faa8`

4. **Build and Run**
   - Select your physical device
   - Build and run the project (‚åò+R)

## üì± Usage

1. **Launch the app** and grant microphone permissions
2. **Say "Hey HeardAI"** to activate the assistant
3. **Speak your command** clearly after the wake word
4. **Review and edit** the transcribed command if needed
5. **Accept or reject** the command for execution

## üéØ Supported Commands

| Command Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Reminders** | "remind me to call mom", "set reminder for meeting" |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Services
- **AudioManager**: Handles wake word detection and audio processing
- **WhisperService**: Google Speech-to-Text integration
- **SiriService**: Command parsing and Siri execution
- **SpeechRecognizer**: On-device speech recognition fallback

### Key Technologies
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **AVFoundation**: Audio capture and processing
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**: High-accuracy transcription
- **SiriKit**: Proper Siri integration with intents
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for state management

## üîß Configuration

### Required Permissions
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>HeardAI needs microphone access to listen for voice commands and the wake word "Hey HeardAI".</string>

<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>HeardAI uses speech recognition to accurately transcribe your voice commands before sending them to Siri.</string>
```

### Build Settings
- **iOS Deployment Target**: 16.0
- **Swift Language Version**: Swift 5
- **Enable Bitcode**: No

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Wake word detection in quiet environment
2. Wake word detection in noisy environment
3. Command transcription accuracy
4. Siri command execution
5. Command confirmation flow

### Demo Mode
- Use the "Test Command (Demo)" button to simulate wake word detection
- Test the command confirmation system without voice input

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Speech recognition not available"**
- Ensure testing on physical device (not simulator)
- Check speech recognition permissions
- Verify internet connectivity

**"Google Speech API error"**
- Verify API key is valid and active
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure API quotas haven't been exceeded

**"Wake word not detected"**
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check that the app is in the foreground
